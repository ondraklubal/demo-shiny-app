This is a demo shiny app which I created to show what use cases the shiny app can serve to. It's an ongoing project which gets updated from time to time.

*** IMPORTANT ***
For running the application, you need both R and Rstudio installed on your device. Then in Rstudio simply click Run app and a pop-up window will show up.
